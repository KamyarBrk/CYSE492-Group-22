What is the target (e.g., a network, a web application, a cloud environment, a local machine)?\n2. Do you have any specific scope or constraints (e.g., IP ranges, services, ports)?\n3. Are there any particular goals or areas you\u2019d like to focus on (e.g., network discovery, host enumeration, vulnerability scanning)?\n\nOnce I have that information, I can outline the next steps and any tools or techniques that would be useful for your enumeration."
